# Project Purpose

- The wishborn/upgrades package is a Laravel 9.* package that provides a simple way to process deployments upgrades in apps.
- This package provides a functionality similiar to migrations. A user can create an ugrade script that only runs if it hasn't been processed 
- the package provides artisan commands for making a new upgrade, running it and checking the status of upgrades.
- When an upgrade is running it automatically creates a database and rolls back if the upgrade failed.
